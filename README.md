# alarm-cli

> This is a alarm CLI application built using Ink, React, Typescript and Nodejs. I mentioned React but that doesn't mean that is web, electron or native app. Ink provide a React wrapper to build CLI applications easily by internally using Yoga, Chalk and other helper libraries for building CLI in Nodejs.

## Build

Build the application first before using the app.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

this command will create a dist folder in the current directory

## Run

There are two ways to run the application.

```bash
$ npm run cli
// this will build the CLI first and run the application
```

```bash
$ alarm-cli
// For this your have to manually build the CLI first using above command
```
